Description of the data and file structure
Dataset for: "Disentangling seed availability and establishment filters at alpine treelines through a decade‑long field manipulation"

Data is in order of the analysis, and are as follows:
1.Code_brm.R - Fit age-class- and site-specific ZINB models in brms.

2.Code_extract_interaction_summaries.R - Extract treatment×driver interaction summaries from a list of brms models.

3.Code_seed.R -  ZINB with interaction between scaled log(seedlag) and Site for year-1 seedling

4.Code_BRT.R - Fit per-site BRT and combine predictions.

5.FIGURE_2.R - plotting FIGURE 2

6.FIGURE_S2S3.R - plotting FIGURE S2 and S3

7..RData, brm_models.rds, BRT_model.rds and seed_model.rds - final fited models

8.data_sgs.xlsx - Raw observation data
